                    <p class="p-main">
                        "Space of Isolation" is a short video game created to demonstrate that music and sound effects
                        in
                        game can exist as an independent musical work. All sounds and music in this game were
                        implemented
                        with Audiokinetic's Wwise audio engine. </p>

                <p class="p-main">
                    Most of sound effects used in this project were recorded or synthesised by me. I also used some
                    sounds from audio libraries. These sounsd were heavily modified to keep consistant style of audio
                    throughout entire project. In order of achievieng desired effect of sounds and music functioning as
                    independent musical wrok, all sounds were synchronised with music after they were imported into
                    Wwise. </p>

                        coexist
                        with it and togheter create independent musical work.</p>

                        This video shows final version of my bachelor's thesis project. "Annihilation" was a short game
                        created to demonstrate how adaptive music should be implemented in games. It was also the
                        subject of my bachelor's thesis. I created music in FL Studio and implemented it to the game
                        using FMOD Studio. Full soundtrack is available in the music section of this website.

                        couple of days. The name of the game was generated by online name generator and it was asigned
                        to our team. I was responsible for music and sound effects.</p>

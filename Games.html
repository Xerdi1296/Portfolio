                <p class="p-videos">This section consists of games and projects which I worked on as sound,
                    level or game
                    designer. As sound designer I use FL Studio and Reaper for creating and recording sound effects.All
                    levels included in projects available on this page were made in Unreal Engine 4. Apart from tools
                    built inside Unreal I also used some third party tools and assets from Epic Games store.</p>

                    <p class="p-videos">
                        "Space of Isolation" is a short video game created to demonstrate that music and sound effects
                        in
                        game can exist as an independent musical work. All sounds and music in this game were
                        implemented
                        with Audiokinetic's Wwise audio engine. </p>

                        Soundtrack of "Space of Isolation" consists of 4 compositions each of them designed to play in
                        different areas of the level in the game. Every sound effect is synchronised with music to
                        coexist
                        with it and togheter create independent musical work.</p>

                        This video shows final version of my bachelor's thesis project. "Annihilation" was a short game
                        created to demonstrate how adaptive music should be implemented in games. It was also the
                        subject of my bachelor's thesis. I created music in FL Studio and implemented it to the game
                        using FMOD Studio. Full soundtrack is available in the music section of this website.

                        In July 2017 I took part in Game Jam which was part of LAG - Letnia Akademia Gier. This event
                        was orginized by University of Silesia. Myself along with the team, was working on this game for
                        couple of days. The name of the game was generated by online name generator and it was asigned
                        to our team. I was responsible for music and sound effects.</p>

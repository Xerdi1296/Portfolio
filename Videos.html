            <h4>Video Editing</h4>
            <p class="p-main">
                I started editing videos in 2015. For last 7 years I have gained some experience while working on
                various projects both professionally and as part of collaboration with YouTbe channels.
                Below you will find examples of videos I worked on as video eidor. Most of videos available on this
                website were edited in Adobe Premiere Pro but I also edit on Davinci Resolve. Apart from video editing I
                also had an opportunity to appear in a music video made by "Silent Choir" of Universtiy of Silesia. My
                appearence in this video was part of collaboration with "Silent Choir" in 2019.

                    <h4>Burnart</h4>

                    <p class="p-main ">
                        My history with Burnart began in October 2021 when I started my one month internship. During
                        that
                        month
                        I
                        learned
                        how to professionaly edit videos in Adobe Premiere Pro and I also learned the basics of
                        Adobe
                        After
                        Effects.<br>
                        ​My
                        first tasks consisted of editing short vlogs and few corporate videos.
                        <br><br>
                        After that I started working for the
                        Burnart and I worked on more advanced projects.
                        Below you will find two videos I worked on for Burnart. ​First is a 2022 season preview of
                        Strzegom
                        Horse
                        Trials.
                        Second video is a short reportage about Ball Hockey European Championship which took place
                        in
                        Bratislava
                        in
                        2019.

                        Working for Burnart also allowed me to gain some experience on the set and I had an
                        opportunity
                        to
                        use
                        my
                        sound design experience to record a voice over which was needed for the video we were
                        working
                        on.
                        When
                        my
                        experience grew, I also worked on a few commercials and more corporate videos.

                    I started editing videos for Gung Ho Vids in 2015. First video I edited for this channel was
                    short
                    60 second trailer. After that video was released our collaboration advanced and I worked on
                    other
                    projects. Most of the videos I worked on were short compilations which showed what type of
                    content
                    is available on Gung Ho Vids. In 2021 we started creating new type of videos. These films were
                    more
                    focused on specific type of vehicle or certain branch of the US military. </p>

                    Since begining of March 2022 both videos are not available to watch on YouTube. Because of that
                    I
                    put an article
                    about one of the videos which is available on the website of University of Silesia. The main
                    idea of
                    the video was to express graditute to all man and women who were involved in the fight with
                    Covid-19
                    epidemic. Song used in this clip is made by Polish artist Filip Lato.
